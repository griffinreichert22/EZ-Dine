# EZ-Dine

> EZ Dine is a simple web application for in-restaurant ordering to reduce wait staff cost and streamline the overall restaurant service. It was inspired by Nico's dad, who owned a restaurant for over 20 years and constantly vented his frustrations. He didn't think it made sense to have servers, especially considering they make so much money, get to pocket the entirety of the tip, and constantly make mistakes when attending to customers. Nico's dad thought it would make a lot more sense to have an application where people could enjoy their meal without having to deal with going through a server to obtain their food, other necessities, or the paycheck. Our version of EZ Dine obviously isn't what the full version would look like, but gives a good outlook as to what the full version would expect to be like.

### API's
There are three API routes: customers, employees, and menu. Every route supports some form of get, post, put, and delete depending on the necessities of the route. The corresponding routes are defined at the top of each javascript file containing the routes, but are /customers, /employees, and /menu for customers, employees, and the menu respectively. The routes build on the route URL's for different API requests.
